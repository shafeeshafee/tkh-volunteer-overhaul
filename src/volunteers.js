I'm happy to help review your code, explain any concepts you're having trouble with, bounce ideas back and forth with you about how to make software do particular things, and if desired, help refer you to anyplace I have a foot in the door because either I or a friend works there.",

I’m invested in the intersection of art, tech, and intersectional activism and strive to incorporate that in all the work I do! I was lucky to find tech pretty early in high school, and made a video game called Tampon Run that went viral because of its focus on addressing the stigma around menstruation. It went on to win a Webby Award and garnered the attention of major media publications like MSNBC, Seventeen, Teen Vogue, and Huffington Post. Although I recently graduated college, I’m currently about to begin full-time work as a video game developer at Microsoft for the Forza game franchise. Happy to talk about video game development, being a queer WOC in tech, and networking!",
