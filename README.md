# TKH Volunteer Portal Overhaul

#### A UI UX overhaul for The Knowledge House volunteer portal.

This project was completed for the Bloomberg x TKH Hack of Knowledge coding hackathon.

Our coding bootcamp's volunteer portal was not optimized for navigation and accessibility. So we decided to advance their mission by revamping their entire volunteer portal with beautiful and convenient user interfaces and design.
